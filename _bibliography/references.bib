	abstract = {The rise of the Internet of Things ({IoT}) has led to a significant increase in the number of connected devices that stream data in our homes, offices and industrial spaces. However, as the number of these devices increases, the costs of actively maintaining and replacing batteries becomes prohibitive at scale. Recent work on Quasistatic Cavity Resonance ({QSCR}), offers the possibility of seamless wireless power transfer ({WPT}) to receivers placed anywhere inside large indoor spaces. This work aims to solve two unexplored and critical missing pieces needed to realize this vision of ubiquitous {WPT}. First, we demonstrate a full end-to-end {QSCR}-based {WPT} system that is capable of simultaneously charging multiple custom designed nodes nearly anywhere in the 4.9 m x 4.9 m x 2.3 m test room. Second, this work utilizes the {WPT} mechanism as a communication channel, where nodes communicate with a centralized reader and to each other via load modulation. Through analysis and experiments, the proposed system shows that 10 receiver nodes can be safely and efficiently wirelessly charged and the end node to end node communication rate can achieve from 1 kbps without occurring any errors, up to 5 kbps with 6\% {BER} while the end node to central unit can achieve 10 kbps without occurring any errors.},

This intuitive manipulation allows users to easily add wireless power transmission capabilities to everyday objects. The properties of the sheet such as thinness, flexibility, and lightness make our sheet highly compatible with various configurations. We contribute a set of technical principles for the design of circuitry, which integrates H-tree wiring and time division power supply techniques. H-tree wiring allows the sheet to remain functional even when cut from the outside of the sheet, whereas time division power supply avoids the reduction in power transfer efficiency caused by the magnetic interference between adjacent transmitter coils. Through the evaluations, we found that our time division power supply scheme mitigates the degradation of power transfer efficiency and successfully improves the average efficiency. Furthermore, we present four applications which integrates our sheet into daily objects: wireless charging furniture, bag, jacket, and craft; these applications confirmed the feasibility of our prototype.},

	abstract = {Wireless charging pads such as Qi are rapidly gaining ground, but their limited power supply range still requires precise placement on a specific point. 2-D wireless power transfer ({WPT}) sheets consisting of coil arrays are one well-known counterpart to extend this range. However, these approaches require custom-made designs by expert engineers; what we need is a {WPT} system that can be reconfigured by simply placing ready-made modules on the intended surface (e.g., table, floor, shelf board, etc). In this paper, we present "Alvus", a reconfigurable 2-D {WPT} system which enables such simple construction of {WPT} surfaces. Our system is based on multihop {WPT} that composes "virtual power cords" and consists of three types of ready-made resonator modules: (i) transmitter, which outputs energy, (ii) relays, which pass energy down to the next module, and (iii) receivers, which receive energy and charge the loads. We show that power can be transferred efficiently (over 25\%) within a range of 19.6 m2 using a single transmitter. We implemented an end-to-end {WPT} system and demonstrated that Alvus is capable of intuitive construction/reconfiguration of {WPT} surfaces, as well as automatically deciding the power routes based on the sensed information (e.g., receiver location, module placement, obstructive objects).},

	abstract = {We propose Silver Tape, a simple yet novel fabrication technique to transfer inkjet-printed silver traces from paper onto versatile substrates, without time-/space- consuming processes such as screen printing or heat sintering. This allows users to quickly implement silver traces with a variety of properties by exploiting a wide range of substrates. For instance, high flexibility can be achieved with Scotch tape, high transparency with polydimethylsiloxane ({PDMS}), heat durability with Kapton polyimide tape, water solubility with 3M water-soluble tape, and beyond. Many of these properties are not achievable with conventional substrates that are used for inkjet-printing conductive traces. Specifically, our technique leverages the commonly undesired low adhesion property of the inkjet printing films and repurposes these films as temporary transfer media. We describe our fabrication methods with a library of materials we can utilize, evaluate the mechanical and electrical properties of the transferred traces, and conclude with several demonstrative applications. We believe Silver Tape enriches novel interactions for the ubiquitous computing domain, by enabling digital fabrication of electronics on versatile materials, surfaces, and shapes.},

	abstract = {Energy-efficient and unconstrained wearable sensing platforms are essential for ubiquitous healthcare and activity monitoring applications. This paper presents Twin Meander Coil for wirelessly connecting battery-free on-body sensors to a textile-based reader knitted into clothing. This connection is based on passive inductive telemetry ({PIT}), wherein an external reader coil collects data from passive sensor coils via the magnetic field. In contrast to standard active sensing techniques, {PIT} does not require the reader to power up the sensors. Thus, the reader can be fabricated using a lossy conductive thread and industrial knitting machines. Furthermore, the sensors can superimpose information such as {ID}, touch, rotation, and pressure on its frequency response. However, conventional {PIT} technology needs a strong coupling between the reader and the sensor, requiring the reader to be small to the same extent as the sensors' size. Thus, applying this technology to body-scale sensing systems is challenging. To enable body-scale readout, Twin Meander Coil enhances the sensitivity of {PIT} technology by dividing the body-scale meander-shaped reader coils into two parts and integrating them so that they support the readout of each other. To demonstrate its feasibility, we built a prototype with a knitting machine, evaluated its sensing ability, and demonstrated several applications.},
