  abstract: Resonator design methods play an important role in realizing efficient
    wireless power transfer via magnetic resonant coupling (WPT-MRC) systems. In WPT-MRC
    systems, transmitting (Tx) resonator arrays are often used to extend the range
    of the power supply. However, it is difficult to design a receiving (Rx) resonator
    that prevents significant drops in transfer efficiency across the Tx resonator
    array owing to the complexity that stems from fluctuating coupling coefficients.
    In order to resolve this difficulty, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm-based
    Rx resonator array design method. Using the proposed design method, the computed
    minimum transfer efficiency of a power supply system using a Tx resonator array
    increased from 3.8% to 42.6%, and the computed results were verified by simulations
    and measurements.

  abstract: "In this paper, we propose a passive and contactless epidermal pressure
    sensor patch printed on a paper substrate with silver nano-particle ink. This
    disposable patch can be used to measure the pressure between the clothes and the
    human body. Different from the conventional pressure sensors, the pressure can
    be measured wirelessly without disturbing the motion of the users. The sensor
    circuit pattern is printed by a conductive inkjet printer and the sensor's pressure
    value is detected by a reader coil through the change of the capacitance of an
    LC resonant circuit. We propose a sensor design method that minimizes the effect
    of the human body. We demonstrate our sensor patch by measuring the pressure exerted
    by compression garments whose pressure distribution is important for the wearer's
    health.\r"

  abstract: The transfer efficiency of a resonant wireless power transfer system highly
    depends on the load impedance and the reactance of the resonators. In many practical
    applications, these parameters fluctuate by the variation of operating conditions.
    Therefore, adaptive impedance tuning methods are necessary in order to continuously
    achieve high-efficiency power transfer. To provide a countermeasure to this problem,
    this paper proposes a DC-based resonator reactance tuning method which assembles
    a variable inductor. Based on this reactance tuning method, a DC-based load impedance
    tuning method which assembles a variable K-inverter is also proposed. This reactance
    tuning method and load impedance tuning method both utilize the non-linearity
    of ferrite cores. Through measurements at 6.78 MHz, it is shown that the reactance
    of the high-Q coil can be tuned from 80 Ω to 113 Ω and the characteristic impedance
    component of the K-inverter can be tuned from 39 Ω to 72 Ω using non-optimized,
    basic configurations of the proposed methods.

  abstract: The majority of existing wireless power transfer (WPT) solutions are limited
    to two-dimensional (2-D) configurations, which limits mobility when charging electronic
    devices. What is needed are systems capable of 3-D WPT, which can deliver power
    everywhere throughout large volumes. Prior work on quasistatic cavity resonance
    (QSCR) showed promising results for ubiquitous WPT at room scales or larger. However,
    many challenges remain for QSCR, such as the need for a conductive pole in the
    middle of the room and the power efficiency that is not high over the entire cavity
    volume. To address these two issues, this letter introduces a room-scale resonator
    that possesses a “pole independent” (PI) mode, which can be operated without a
    pole. It is shown by finite-element simulations that by using the PI mode alone,
    power can be delivered to 93% of the 54 m 3 volume with over 50% efficiency. Moreover,
    the PI mode and the “pole dependent” (PD) mode, which was used in previous QSCR
    work, can coexist in the same resonator. These two modes can be selectively stimulated
    by shifting the operation frequency by less than 1%, and no physical switching
    components are required. It is shown by simulations that power can be delivered
    with over 66% efficiency to any location in the room by using this dual-mode operation.

  abstract: 'The performance of a wireless power transfer (WPT) system is highly dependent
    on the complex impedance of the receiver (RX). Therefore, dynamic complex impedance
    tuning methods are critical pieces for gaining sufficient control over WPT systems.
    However, prior methods cannot achieve the following three requirements simultaneously:
    high-frequency (i.e. MHz, GHz) operation, continuous complex impedance tuning,
    and few additional components. To overcome these challenges, we present a dynamic
    complex impedance tuning method based on multiple-input DC/DC converters andLC
    filters. The active operations used in our method are closed in the low-frequency
    (i.e. after-rectification) region of the circuit; it has the promise of achieving
    the three above-mentioned requirements. The proposed method was evaluated through
    theoretical analysis and SPICE simulations assuming a 6.78 MHz near-field WPT
    system. It was shown that the complex impedance can be tuned in a wide range in
    the complex plane; by using our method, the fluctuation of power factor can be
    suppressed to 1%, whereas prior methods show 12%.'

  abstract: 'Wireless charging pads such as Qi are rapidly gaining ground, but their
    limited power supply range still requires precise placement on a specific point.
    2-D wireless power transfer (WPT) sheets consisting of coil arrays are one well-known
    counterpart to extend this range. However, these approaches require custom-made
    designs by expert engineers; what we need is a WPT system that can be reconfigured
    by simply placing ready-made modules on the intended surface (e.g., table, floor,
    shelf board, etc). In this paper, we present "Alvus", a reconfigurable 2-D WPT
    system which enables such simple construction of WPT surfaces. Our system is based
    on multihop WPT that composes "virtual power cords" and consists of three types
    of ready-made resonator modules: (i) transmitter, which outputs energy, (ii) relays,
    which pass energy down to the next module, and (iii) receivers, which receive
    energy and charge the loads. We show that power can be transferred efficiently
    (over 25%) within a range of 19.6 m2 using a single transmitter. We implemented
    an end-to-end WPT system and demonstrated that Alvus is capable of intuitive construction/reconfiguration
    of WPT surfaces, as well as automatically deciding the power routes based on the
    sensed information (e.g., receiver location, module placement, obstructive objects).'

  abstract: "Most existing wireless power transfer (WPT) solutions are limited to
    2-D configurations, which limits mobility when charging electronics. What is needed
    are 3-D WPT, which can deliver power anywhere in large volumes (e.g., factories,
    rooms, toolbox, etc). WPT using quasistatic cavity resonators (QSCR) proposed
    a route towards truly ubiquitous WPT, which safely charges devices as they enter
    a WPT enabled space. However, several drawbacks exist to this approach such as
    the need for a central pole and the spatially non-uniform power availability.
    To address these issues, we demonstrate a WPT system based on \"multimode\" QSCR
    [4]; this structure possess two resonant modes: pole dependent (PD) mode, which
    resembles the previous QSCR work and pole independent (PI) mode, which works whether
    or not the pole exist. This structure enables two operations: (i) pole-less operation,
    which works to the same degree as the previous QSCR without the central pole and
    (ii) dual-mode operation, which although requires the central pole, enables high-efficiency
    WPT all over the volume.\r"

  abstract: "The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a significant increase
    in the number of connected devices that stream data in our homes, offices and
    industrial spaces. However, as the number of these devices increases, the costs
    of actively maintaining and replacing batteries becomes prohibitive at scale.
    Recent work on Quasistatic Cavity Resonance (QSCR), offers the possibility of
    seamless wireless power transfer (WPT) to receivers placed anywhere inside large
    indoor spaces. This work aims to solve two unexplored and critical missing pieces
    needed to realize this vision of ubiquitous WPT. First, we demonstrate a full
    end-to-end QSCR-based WPT system that is capable of simultaneously charging multiple
    custom designed nodes nearly anywhere in the 4.9 m x 4.9 m x 2.3 m test room.
    Second, this work utilizes the WPT mechanism as a communication channel, where
    nodes communicate with a centralized reader and to each other via load modulation.
    Through analysis and experiments, the proposed system shows that 10 receiver nodes
    can be safely and efficiently wirelessly charged and the end node to end node
    communication rate can achieve from 1 kbps without occurring any errors, up to
    5 kbps with 6% BER while the end node to central unit can achieve 10 kbps without
    occurring any errors.\r"

  abstract: "Sharing systems for personal mobility devices (PMDs) with batteries are
    gaining popularity because of their advantages in terms of maneuverability and
    low environmental burdens. However, PMDs suffer from a small battery capacity,
    a lack of charging stations, and the inconvenience of plugging in for charging.
    To solve these problems, we propose retrofitting city spaces into wireless power
    transfer (WPT) stations/pads by placing sheet-like transmitters in available open
    spaces. Many studies have considered WPT for electrical vehicles; however, little
    attention has been given to WPT for PMDs, although they have many unique characteristics
    to consider (e.g., light weight, form factor, sharing ecosystems, and random running
    routes). In this study, we investigated a form of WPT via magnetic resonant coupling
    for PMDs through coil design, analysis, and measurements based on two scenarios:
    (1) charging PMDs at charging stations and (2) charging in-motion PMDs from chargers
    placed on the road. Based on these considerations, we confirmed that around 90
    % transfer efficiency can be obtained in laboratory setups, whereas practical
    setups achieved around 70% efficiency.\r"

  abstract: "The cost of deploying wireless power transfer (WPT) technology into products
    still remains high due to the order-made design process. As a new approach to
    alleviate the engineering cost to adapt to each use-case, a magnetic resonance
    coupling based, reconfigurable 2-D WPT system, which enables users to deploy WPT
    enabled surfaces, simply by arranging ready-made resonator modules was recently
    proposed. In this system, modules communicate with each other via the Bluetooth
    Mesh protocol to Figure out the topology of the modules, detect the position of
    the receiver, and direct power to target device. However, this approach typically
    suffers from errors due to radio interference; as a more natural and robust approach,
    we propose to build a topology construction protocol based on “in-band” communication,
    which rides on the WPT channel and can only communicate with adjacent modules.
    Based on this, we proposed a protocol applicable to 2-D WPT systems, that enables
    robust topology construction and evaluated it through simulations. Through simulations,
    it was discovered that the topology construction can be executed in 2 seconds
    for a 30 module configuration.\r"

  abstract: "We propose Silver Tape, a simple yet novel fabrication technique to transfer
    inkjet-printed silver traces from paper onto versatile substrates, without time-/space-
    consuming processes such as screen printing or heat sintering. This allows users
    to quickly implement silver traces with a variety of properties by exploiting
    a wide range of substrates. For instance, high flexibility can be achieved with
    Scotch tape, high transparency with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), heat durability
    with Kapton polyimide tape, water solubility with 3M water-soluble tape, and beyond.
    Many of these properties are not achievable with conventional substrates that
    are used for inkjet-printing conductive traces. Specifically, our technique leverages
    the commonly undesired low adhesion property of the inkjet printing films and
    repurposes these films as temporary transfer media. We describe our fabrication
    methods with a library of materials we can utilize, evaluate the mechanical and
    electrical properties of the transferred traces, and conclude with several demonstrative
    applications. We believe Silver Tape enriches novel interactions for the ubiquitous
    computing domain, by enabling digital fabrication of electronics on versatile
    materials, surfaces, and shapes.\r"

  abstract: Caregivers hug their infants to express affection and joy. However, it
    remains unknown how infants react to being hugged. Here we examined heart rate
    responses in first-year infants during a hug, hold, and tight hug from parents.
    Infants older than four months showed an increased R-R interval (RRI) during a
    hug, indicating reduced heart rates and pronounced parasympathetic activity. Few
    head movements predicted a higher RRI increase in infants during a parental hug
    compared with that during a hold and tight hug. Infants did not show an increased
    RRI during a hug from a female stranger. Infants younger than four months did
    not show RRI increase during parental hug but exhibited a decreased RRI correlated
    with contact pressure. Parents showed an increased RRI during hugging their infants.
    These results suggest the parent-infant hug underlies the parent-infant bonding
    and psychophysiological development of infants.

  abstract: "As robots become more complex, small, and sophisticated, the cost and
    effort necessary for “wiring” become critical; the complex wiring makes the fabrication
    costly and necessitates care about space and stiffness of wires, which can inhibit
    the deformation of soft-bodied robots. The concept of power bus, which powers,
    controls, and monitors multiple slave modules (e.g., actuators, sensors) via a
    shared bus is one countermeasure for this challenge. However, handling many slave
    modules in real-time remains an unsolved issue; prior work suffers from a delay
    corresponding to the number of slaves or requires a rich signal processing unit
    in each slave module, which makes them unsuitable for controlling numerous actuators.
    To address this issue, we propose a frequency-multiplexed power bus, which integrates
    bandpass filters and load-modulation communication; our method enables us to power,
    control, and monitor all slave modules at once via a single pair of wires. Through
    analysis and experiments, we showed that eight nodes can be accommodated within
    a 9 MHz frequency band and can be independently controlled; finally, a caterpillar-like
    robot with four sensors and actuators was successfully driven by Ramus.\r"

  abstract: "Glasses are a suitable platform for embedding sensors and displays around
    our heads to support our daily lives. Furthermore, aesthetic features, durability,
    and portability are essential properties of glasses. However, designing such smart
    glasses is challenging, because connecting different glass frames both mechanically
    and electrically, result in smart glasses with bulky hinges. To overcome this
    challenge, we propose a new design to embed inductively coupled coil pairs adjacent
    to glasses hinges to deliver power and data wirelessly to the frames. Positioning
    the coils next to the hinges creates sufficient area for a large transmission
    and reception coil while maintaining the utility of the glasses. Consequently,
    we were able to achieve over 85% power efficiency and a communication rate of
    50 Mbps between coils that are small enough to be embedded inside the frame of
    conventional glasses, available on the market.\r"

  abstract: "TelemetRing is a batteryless and wireless ring-shaped keyboard that supports
    command and text entry in daily lives by detecting finger typing on various surfaces.
    The proposed inductive telemetry approach eliminates bulky batteries or capacitors
    from the ring part. Each ring consists of a sensor coil (the ring part itself),
    1-DoF piezoelectric accelerometer, and varactor diode; moreover, it has different
    resonant frequencies. Typing shocks slightly shift the resonant frequency, and
    these are detected by a wrist-mounted readout coil. 5-bit chord keyboard is realized
    by attaching five sensor rings on five fingers. Our evaluation shows that the
    prototype achieved the tiny (6 g, 3.5 cm^3) ring sensor and 89.7% of typing detection
    ratio.\r"

  abstract: "Personal mobility devices (PMDs) are gaining ground as a modern form
    of transportation that can seamlessly connect the first and the last miles to
    public transportation. The batteries installed in these devices are currently
    charged via wires, which enforce unnecessary charging mainly done by humans and
    exposed electrodes that limit durability in outdoor use. To overcome these issues,
    we aim to introduce wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, in which PMDs get autonomously
    charged as they are placed at parking stations. Despite many research efforts
    on WPT for electric vehicles (EVs), however, adopting WPT systems for PMDs - which
    requires lighter weight than those for EVs - has not been well explored. Therefore
    in this paper, we (a) investigate how the body material of PMDs affects WPT performance
    and (b) explore potential designs of new PMDs that integrate WPT performance as
    a design requirement. Through evaluations on the shift in resonant frequency,
    Q factor, and power transfer efficiency, we present a PMD that can achieve efficient
    (> 90%) WPT without impairing basic functions as a mobility device.\r"

  abstract: "Deploying 2-D arrays of multiple transmitters is a promising approach
    for extending wireless power transfer (WPT) to wide surfaces. However, these arrays
    involve “null zones,” where the transfer efficiency drops significantly. Although
    this problem can be hypothetically addressed by employing a receiver array and
    dynamically selecting the appropriate transmitter/receiver pair, designing receiver
    arrays that achieve high efficiency throughout the surface remains a challenging
    task. In this study, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-based approach to designing
    receiver arrays free of “null zones”. The main objective is enhancing worst-case
    scenarios, which in contrast to improving best-case scenarios, reveals significant
    complexities due to the need for considering numerous possible placements. We
    overcome this problem by establishing a design flow that leverages the simulated
    transfer efficiency at numerous positions throughout the surface. Our approach
    increased the simulated transfer efficiency at the worst position from 3.8% to
    42.6%, and we confirmed these results through measurements at the extracted points.\r"

  abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) has the significant potential for soft-bodied
    continuum robots to extend the operational time limitlessly and reduce weight.
    However, rigid power receiver coils, widely used in WPT, hinder the continuum
    deformation of the robot, and as a result, the function realization using the
    continuum deformation (e.g., locomotion) is impaired. Therefore, this article
    introduces that a soft-bodied continuum robot can be designed by using thin film
    receiver coils and an inductively coupled wireless powering solution without sacrificing
    the continuum deformation and locomotion ability. A system is described for powering
    and controlling a soft robotic caterpillar consisting of nothing more than its
    continuum structure, actuators, and thin/flexible power receiving coils.

  abstract: "Widespread research is being conducted on computational materials. The
    challenge for the realization of computational materials is how to weave computers
    into everyday objects consisting of various shapes and form factors. One idea
    to achieve this vision is to build physical computational particles that can cooperatively
    communicate among others and, thereby, change the whole shape like clay. Wireless
    communication and power transfer are keys to making such computing particles happen.
    Thus, we introduce an approach to embody these particles using multiple tiny IC
    chips, which wirelessly cooperate with each other. This article shows the current
    state-of-the-art wireless communication and power transfer technologies integrated
    into IC chips to achieve fine-grained shape deformation of computers. Moreover,
    this article also presents recent trends and future directions in shape-changing

  abstract: "The need for cable connection with soft robotic systems suppresses the
    benefits granted by their softness and flexibility. Such systems can be untethered
    by equipping batteries or by relying on non-electrical actuation mechanisms. However,
    these approaches cannot simultaneously support long-term and intelligent operations.
    This research examines a proposed wireless soft actuator based on wireless power
    transfer (WPT) and dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) technology, thereby realizing
    soft robomore diversified application and long-term locomotion. A compact conical
    DEA fabrication process is presented with 6 mm periodic linear output and design
    of a lightweight WPT receiver that weighs only 13 g integrated with a driver circuit.
    Evaluation results show that this system remotely powers the DEA and the intelligent
    peripheral circuits for system control. Furthermore, our design seamlessly bridges
    the WPT system, power-efficient in low-voltage output conditions, and the DEA,
    which requires high-voltage input (kV) for deformation, by leveraging high-voltage
    boost-converters. Experimentally obtained results demonstrate untethered DEA operation
    at 170 mm from the transmitter. Also, we demonstrated applying this DEA as a wireless
    pump.\r"

  abstract: Magnetoquasistatic wireless power transfer can be used to charge and power
    electronic devices such as smartphones and small home appliances. However, existing
    coil-based transmitters, which are composed of wire conductors, have a limited
    range. Here we show that multimode quasistatic cavity resonance can provide room-scale
    wireless power transfer. The approach uses multidirectional, widely distributed
    currents on conductive surfaces that are placed around the target volume. It generates
    multiple, mutually unique, three-dimensional magnetic field patterns, where each
    pattern is attributed to different eigenmodes of a single room-scale resonator.
    Using these modes together, a power delivery efficiency exceeding 37.1% can be
    achieved throughout a 3 m × 3 m × 2 m test room. With this approach, power exceeding
    50 W could potentially be delivered to mobile receivers in accordance with safety
    guidelines.

  abstract: "Wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance coupling offers the prospect
    of autonomously charging connected devices. Previous work demonstrated that the
    system deployment can be facilitated by “routing” power on 2-D relay resonator
    arrays, using the multi-hop phenomenon. Power propagates through untethered relay
    resonators in such systems, and the routing strategy significantly affects the
    power transfer efficiency. However, most previous studies limit the routing to
    line-shaped routes, which compromises power transfer efficiency to preserve the
    simplicity of analysis. Here we show a surface routing approach, which can be
    orderly generated and is more efficient than linear routing. The confronting challenge
    is the complex representation of cross-coupled relays, which this work overcomes
    by conditioning the resonators’ current by appending additional loading conditions
    to the relays. Simulation-based evaluations show that the proposed approach improves
    the efficiency by up to 10% in 1.5 m range power delivery.\r"

  abstract: "Energy-efficient and unconstrained wearable sensing platforms are essential
    for ubiquitous healthcare and activity monitoring applications. This paper presents
    Twin Meander Coil for wirelessly connecting battery-free on-body sensors to a
    textile-based reader knitted into clothing. This connection is based on passive
    inductive telemetry (PIT), wherein an external reader coil collects data from
    passive sensor coils via the magnetic field. In contrast to standard active sensing
    techniques, PIT does not require the reader to power up the sensors. Thus, the
    reader can be fabricated using a lossy conductive thread and industrial knitting
    machines. Furthermore, the sensors can superimpose information such as ID, touch,
    rotation, and pressure on its frequency response. However, conventional PIT technology
    needs a strong coupling between the reader and the sensor, requiring the reader
    to be small to the same extent as the sensors' size. Thus, applying this technology
    to body-scale sensing systems is challenging. To enable body-scale readout, Twin
    Meander Coil enhances the sensitivity of PIT technology by dividing the body-scale
    meander-shaped reader coils into two parts and integrating them so that they support
    the readout of each other. To demonstrate its feasibility, we built a prototype
    with a knitting machine, evaluated its sensing ability, and demonstrated several
    applications.\r"

  abstract: "Wireless power transfer technology has seen steady advances in recent
    years, yet seamlessly charging devices within large volumes of space remains challenging.
    Although quasi-static cavity resonators have recently demonstrated safe wireless
    power transfer at room-scale sizes at significant power levels, previous work
    investigated this concept using coupled mode theory, lacking utility from the
    engineering perspective. This work presents a circuit model analysis of quasi-static
    cavity resonance-based wireless power transfer systems, which creates a critical
    conceptual bridge to the electrical engineering community and reveals factors
    that dominate the system performance and power transfer efficiency. A closed-form
    circuit model is derived from the geometrical properties of the system by analyzing
    the field distribution of a cylindrical cavity structure and is experimentally
    validated using a room-scale quasi-static cavity resonator. Finally, we demonstrate
    the utility of the derived circuit model through case studies for designing impedance
    matching circuits and optimization of the QSCR geometry.\r"

    tiny acoustic wearable devices such as bone conduction wireless headsets. However,
    this small form factor poses inconvenience when controlling these devices, as
    they cannot equip large footprint intuitive interfaces such as volume sliders
    and touch screens. This paper presents a technique using acoustic responses measured
    by a bone conduction speaker and a microphone to utilize the ear as a touch input
    interface. We discovered that a finger placed on different parts of the ear affects
    the acoustic radiation characteristic of the ear, modulating the leaked sound,
    and by leveraging this effect, the touch position can be estimated. Experimental
    results show that five distinct frequency responses with five different finger
    positions can be obtained, which indicates that our method could allow bone conduction
    headsets to capture continuous finger positions without additional hardware.\r"

  abstract: "This letter presents trimmed aperture corner reflectors (CRs) for assigning
    angle selectivity to chipless radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. This
    angle selectivity can benefit the landmark use of CR-based tags by exhibiting
    different signals in each direction, which enables infrastructure-to-device communication
    with rich context. The key idea of this work is to subtract retroreflections in
    unwanted directions by partially trimming the aperture of CRs, allowing control
    over the radar crosssection (RCS) when looked at from different angles. We developed
    a geometric analysis based on the effective area of CRs to determine the appropriate
    aperture trimming for the desired angular characteristics. This method can append
    direction selectivity to various CR-based chipless RFID tags. We demonstrate a
    trimmed CR-based spatially coded chipless RFID that can present different 4-bit
    IDs in three different directions while maintaining a large RCS of 1.80 dBsm.
    The proposed method can artificially code the selective reflections in passive
    reflectors and is suitable for the applications requiring large detectability,
    such as outdoor landmarks and signs.\r"

  abstract: "This paper investigates a novel millimeter wave (mmWave) radar-based
    inclination estimation to enhance the landing capabilities of unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) in poor visibility conditions. Unlike SAR based approaches, this
    method facilitates one-shot estimation by using known reflector patterns on landing
    surfaces. As a first step, we evaluate the performance of the estimation with
    obtained distance information, assuming that the coordinates of the UAV and port
    are known. The experimental results demonstrate that mmWave radar with centimeter-ordered
    resolution can estimate the inclination of less than 5° errors.\r"

  abstract: "This paper presents MilliSign, a guidance system based on a batteryless
    tag to support unmanned aerial vehicles in all-weather conditions. Conventional
    batteryless guidance systems using visual signs fail to work in inclement weather
    due to poor visibility. The need for all-weather operation with long-range readability
    encourages the use of millimeter wave (mmWave) radar, which poses challenges in
    providing a wide 3-D read range and low-cost operation. To address these challenges,
    we introduce a corner reflector (CR) array-based chipless RFID tag and a one-shot
    slant range reading procedure with COTS mmWave radar. We establish a novel design
    method for the shape and alignment of CR units to decrease the tag's size and
    expand the 3-D read range. Additionally, we develop a signal-processing pipeline
    based on Root-MUSIC to achieve accurate power and spatial estimation, which facilitate
    automatic tag detection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the tag, measuring 292
    mm × 600 mm × 19 mm and storing 8 bits, can be read by mmWave radar from a distance
    of more than 10 m with a viewing angle of more than 30° in elevation and azimuth.
    Moreover, its performance remains stable in poor visibility conditions and multipath-rich
    environments.\r"

  abstract: "Investigating the relationship between complex behavior and neural activity
    is an established methodology for systems neuroscience. The development of miniature
    head-mounted fluorescent microscopes enables in vivo recording of neural activity
    in freely moving animals and significantly expands the range of behaviors that
    can be studied. However, supplying power to head-mounted systems and acquiring
    recording data is a critical bottleneck in many applications, imposing a need
    for a wired interface that can disrupt behavior or a battery that limits the recording
    time and increases weight. To this end, prior work demonstrated wirelessly driving
    neuroscience tools with low power consumption and data rate demand. However, wirelessly
    interfacing power-hungry and high-bandwidth recording devices such as image sensors
    with miniaturized form factors for small rodents remains a fundamental challenge.\r\nHere
    we present a fully-wireless miniature microscope enabled by novel, wide-range
    magnetic resonance coupling wireless power transfer, and free-space optical communication
    technologies. Unlike prior battery-based wireless miniature microscopes with short
    recording lengths, our method technically offers unlimited recording time by remotely
    supplying energy to the untethered head-mounted device. Furthermore, the high-bandwidth
    communication enabled by the custom-made miniaturized optical communication system
    will allow online monitoring and processing of recording data. Evaluations reveal
    that a fully-wireless design can achieve an imaging performance comparable to
    a typical open-source UCLA Miniscope V4 configuration, and we demonstrate the
    feasibility of the system in several standardized freely-moving rodent tasks.
    The presented technology overcomes the issues provoked by wires and batteries
    and has the promise of unlocking experiment designs that were previously inaccessible,
    such as the long-term recording of complex social activities of multiple freely-moving
    animals. In the future, the presented wireless technologies could be designed
    in a modular form that can seamlessly augment various high-end neural recording
    devices."

  abstract: "Wireless power transfer has the potential to seamlessly power electronic
    systems, such as electric vehicles, industrial robots, and mobile devices. However,
    the leakage magnetic field is a critical bottleneck that limits the transferable
    power level, and heavy ferromagnetic shields are needed for transferring large
    amounts of power. In this letter, we propose a ferrite-less coil design that generates
    an asymmetric magnetic field pattern focused on one side of the resonator, which
    effectively reduces the leakage magnetic field. The key to enabling the asymmetric
    field pattern is a coil winding strategy inspired by the Halbach array, a permanent
    magnet arrangement, which is then tailored for wireless power using an evolutionary
    strategy algorithm. Numerical analyses and simulations demonstrated that the proposed
    coil structure delivers the same amount of power as spiral coils, while achieving
    an 86.6% reduction in magnetic field intensity at a plane located 75 mm away from
    the resonator pair and a power efficiency of 96.0%. We verified our approach by
    measuring the power efficiency and magnetic field intensity of a test wireless
    power system operating at 6.78 MHz. These findings indicate that our approach
    can efficiently deliver over 50 times more power without increasing magnetic field
    exposure, making it a promising solution for high-power wireless power transfer
    applications.\r"

  abstract: "We present a new indoor positioning method to overcome the challenges
    faced by Visible Light Positioning (VLP), specifically its dependency on multiple
    light sources and constraints in environments with high ceilings. Our method employs
    omni-directional LEDs, each modulated at a unique frequency, mounted on the ceiling.
    The system calculates the position by analyzing the luminance and gradient of
    diffused light reflected on the ceiling, captured by the user’s smartphone front
    camera. This allows for accurate distance and angle estimation between the point
    of interest and LEDs with just two light sources. The inherent characteristics
    of ceiling surfaces, being largely unobstructed, enhance the diffusion of modulated
    light, enabling the capture of signals even from partial and indirect views. Experimental
    validation in a setting with a 3. 6m baseline between lights resulted in a 0.
    462m average positioning error and a 21.7-degree average orientation angle error,
    showcasing its efficiency and potential for broad indoor application.\r"

  abstract: High-accuracy indoor positioning systems provide various location-aware
    applications, enhancing our daily ex-periences. The Global Navigation Satellite
    System is difficult to use indoors, leading to the development of various indoor
    positioning methods. Among these, acoustic fingerprint-based positioning, which
    utilizes widely available speakers and microphones, provides robust performance
    in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) environments that are common due to structural obstacles
    and furniture. These approaches typically use Received Signal Strength Indicator
    or Power Spectral Density as location fingerprints but face challenges in achieving
    high positioning accuracy. In this paper, we propose Geometric Sound Profile (GSP),
    a temporal feature of complex reflection waves, enabling high-accuracy localization
    with a single speaker. GSP, defined as the envelope of cross-correlation between
    the transmitted and received signals, starting from the transmission time, serves
    as a highly informative feature encapsulating the multipath-Time-of-Flight. Additionally,
    we implement a Convolutional Neural Network for the estimation of the user’s position
    using GSP. We generated a high-resolution pre-trained model in the simulation
    and fine-tuned it with measurement data, allowing accurate positioning with minimal
    measured training data. Our experiments demonstrated that the median positioning
    error was 0.14 m and the 90th percentile error was 1.23 m in the Line-of-Sight
    environment, and the median positioning error was 0.09 m and the 90th percentile
    error was 1.14 m in the NLOS environment.

  abstract: We present a visible light positioning (VLP) method that allows indoor
    positioning using a smartphone camera with a narrow field of view (FoV). Our method
    employs omni-directional LEDs, each modulated at a unique frequency, mounted on
    the ceiling. The system calculates the 2-D position and azimuth of the smartphone
    by analyzing the brightness of ceiling reflection captured by the user’s smartphone
    front camera. This approach does not necessitate a direct line-of-sight to the
    LEDs, effectively overcomes the FoV limitations, and enables positioning over
    a wider space. We model the ceiling reflection as a transmission path between
    the LEDs and the ceiling, improving coverage and accuracy of estimation for the
    user’s position and azimuth compared to previous work. In experiments with two
    LEDs placed 2.6 m apart, our method covered a space over ten times larger than
    traditional methods, achieving coverage of 50 m^2 with a mean absolute error (MAE)
    in the positioning of 0.46 m and an MAE in azimuth estimation of 13.0 deg.

  abstract: "Low-cost and accurate indoor location information can add spatio-temporal
    context to information systems, enabling new location-aware applications. Time-of-Flight
    (ToF)-based acoustic localization using speakers and microphones allows for localization
    accuracy within a few tens of centimeters, outperforming RF-based techniques.
    However, ToF-based localization requires synchronization between the speaker and
    microphone, i.e., the time offset between them must be known. Previous time offset
    estimation methods required custom hardware for speakers, limiting their practical
    use. Estimating the time offset using a single, unmodified speaker is essential
    for leveraging widely deployed speakers and enhancing coverage. This paper presents
    the first method for time offset estimation using a single speaker and a microphone,
    enabled by two key factors: (i) a time offset computation method that utilizes
    higher-order floor-ceiling reflections as multiple geometrically-constrained virtual
    speakers, and (ii) a signal processing pipeline that isolates these critical reflections
    from numerous others by leveraging the speaker’s frequency-dependent radiation
    pattern. Experiments show that the proposed technique can achieve time offset
    estimation with a 90th percentile error of 259 \U0001D707s at a 5 m distance.
    Furthermore, we implemented a ToF localization systembased on SyncEcho, demonstrating
    a 11.0 cm localization accuracy with a 90th percentile error."
