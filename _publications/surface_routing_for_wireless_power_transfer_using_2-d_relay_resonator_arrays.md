abstract: 'Wireless power transfer via magnetic resonance coupling offers the prospect of autonomously charging connected devices. Previous work demonstrated that the system deployment can be facilitated by “routing” power on 2-D relay resonator arrays, using the multi-hop phenomenon. Power propagates through untethered relay resonators in such systems, and the routing strategy significantly affects the power transfer efficiency. However, most previous studies limit the routing to line-shaped routes, which compromises power transfer efficiency to preserve the simplicity of analysis. Here we show a surface routing approach, which can be orderly generated and is more efficient than linear routing. The confronting challenge is the complex representation of cross-coupled relays, which this work overcomes by conditioning the resonators’ current by appending additional loading conditions to the relays. Simulation-based evaluations show that the proposed approach improves the efficiency by up to 10% in 1.5 m range power delivery.'
