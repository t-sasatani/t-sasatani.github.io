abstract: 'The cost of deploying wireless power transfer (WPT) technology into products still remains high due to the order-made design process. As a new approach to alleviate the engineering cost to adapt to each use-case, a magnetic resonance coupling based, reconfigurable 2-D WPT system, which enables users to deploy WPT enabled surfaces, simply by arranging ready-made resonator modules was recently proposed. In this system, modules communicate with each other via the Bluetooth Mesh protocol to Figure out the topology of the modules, detect the position of the receiver, and direct power to target device. However, this approach typically suffers from errors due to radio interference; as a more natural and robust approach, we propose to build a topology construction protocol based on “in-band” communication, which rides on the WPT channel and can only communicate with adjacent modules. Based on this, we proposed a protocol applicable to 2-D WPT systems, that enables robust topology construction and evaluated it through simulations. Through simulations, it was discovered that the topology construction can be executed in 2 seconds for a 30 module configuration.'
