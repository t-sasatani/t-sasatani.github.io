abstract: 'Wireless power transfer technology has seen steady advances in recent years, yet seamlessly charging devices within large volumes of space remains challenging. Although quasi-static cavity resonators have recently demonstrated safe wireless power transfer at room-scale sizes at significant power levels, previous work investigated this concept using coupled mode theory, lacking utility from the engineering perspective. This work presents a circuit model analysis of quasi-static cavity resonance-based wireless power transfer systems, which creates a critical conceptual bridge to the electrical engineering community and reveals factors that dominate the system performance and power transfer efficiency. A closed-form circuit model is derived from the geometrical properties of the system by analyzing the field distribution of a cylindrical cavity structure and is experimentally validated using a room-scale quasi-static cavity resonator. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the derived circuit model through case studies for designing impedance matching circuits and optimization of the QSCR geometry.'
