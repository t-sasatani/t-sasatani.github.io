abstract: 'Wireless power transfer and energy harvesting are essential to the realization of the Internet of Things (IoT). Design of wireless power transfer technology often requires the knowledge and the skill in electrical engineering, and it is not easy for IoT designers in information science. In addition, due to the diversity of the size and the power consumption of the target `things'', there is still no one-size-fits-all solution. In this paper, we introduce two projects enhances the easiness of the deployment while extending the transmission range. We believe that these system level improvements realized by electrical engineering and information science will increase the usability of the wireless power transmission systems.'
