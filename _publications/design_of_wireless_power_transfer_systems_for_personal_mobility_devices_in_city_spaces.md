abstract: 'Sharing systems for personal mobility devices (PMDs) with batteries are gaining popularity because of their advantages in terms of maneuverability and low environmental burdens. However, PMDs suffer from a small battery capacity, a lack of charging stations, and the inconvenience of plugging in for charging. To solve these problems, we propose retrofitting city spaces into wireless power transfer (WPT) stations/pads by placing sheet-like transmitters in available open spaces. Many studies have considered WPT for electrical vehicles; however, little attention has been given to WPT for PMDs, although they have many unique characteristics to consider (e.g., light weight, form factor, sharing ecosystems, and random running routes). In this study, we investigated a form of WPT via magnetic resonant coupling for PMDs through coil design, analysis, and measurements based on two scenarios: (1) charging PMDs at charging stations and (2) charging in-motion PMDs from chargers placed on the road. Based on these considerations, we confirmed that around 90 % transfer efficiency can be obtained in laboratory setups, whereas practical setups achieved around 70% efficiency.'
