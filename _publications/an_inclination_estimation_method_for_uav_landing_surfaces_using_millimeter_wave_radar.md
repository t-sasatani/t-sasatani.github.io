abstract: 'This paper investigates a novel millimeter wave (mmWave) radar-based inclination estimation to enhance the landing capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in poor visibility conditions. Unlike SAR based approaches, this method facilitates one-shot estimation by using known reflector patterns on landing surfaces. As a first step, we evaluate the performance of the estimation with obtained distance information, assuming that the coordinates of the UAV and port are known. The experimental results demonstrate that mmWave radar with centimeter-ordered resolution can estimate the inclination of less than 5Â° errors.'
